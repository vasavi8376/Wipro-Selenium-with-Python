# Threading is not efficient for CPU-heavy tasks
# Solution → Multiprocessing

# Multiprocessing:

# Creates separate processes
# Each process has its own Python interpreter
# Uses multiple CPU cores

# I/O-Bound  File read, API calls   Threading
# CPU-Bound  Math, data processing  Multiprocessing
